### Getting started

1. Create a Kubernetes cluster. I'm currently testing with [Korifi](https://tutorials.cloudfoundry.org/korifi/local-install/)
2. Deploy a Vault. I'm currently using the [Helm chart](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-helm).
3. Add some Concourse secrets to Vault.
4. Deploy Concourse.  I'm currently using the [Helm chart](https://github.com/concourse/concourse-chart)
